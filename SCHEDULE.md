## Project Repository Setup
The GitHub repository will be created and structured properly. Initial documentation including README and SCHEDULE.md will be added.

## System Architecture & Database Design
The system architecture will be finalized using a client-server model. ER diagrams will be designed to define relationships between Users, Facilities, Availability, Bookings, Payments, and Notifications.

## Backend Setup (Node.js + Express)
The backend server will be initialized using Node.js and Express. Basic routing structure and middleware configuration will be implemented.

## Database Implementation (PostgreSQL)
Database schema will be implemented with proper relational integrity, foreign keys, and transactional behavior to ensure reliable booking management.

## Authentication & Authorization (OTP + JWT)
OTP-based login system will be implemented along with JWT token-based session management and role-based access control for users, managers, and admins.

## Facility & Availability Management APIs
REST APIs will be developed to allow facility managers to create facilities, define availability slots, and manage booking approvals.

## Booking & Payment Integration (Stripe)
Booking engine will be implemented with real-time slot validation. Stripe payment gateway will be integrated for secure online transactions.

## Frontend Development (React.js + Tailwind CSS)
User interface will be developed using React.js with responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Separate dashboards will be created for users and managers.

## Manager Dashboard & Role-based Access
Dashboard features will include booking approval/rejection, facility management, and reporting tools.

## Testing, Debugging & Security Review
System testing will be performed including API testing, UI validation, and security checks (authentication flow, data validation).

## Final Integration & Optimization
All modules will be integrated together. Performance improvements and minor optimizations will be applied.

## Deployment & Documentation Submission
Application will be deployed on AWS. Final documentation and GitHub repository link will be submitted.
